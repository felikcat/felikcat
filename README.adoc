== About
A 22 year old male currently studying a 2022 CompTIA+ Networking book and using Zig.

I prefer to program in Zig or C despite knowing little, but know a good amount of Bash. PowerShell I know enough to hold my own, but my knowledge in it is going rust over time.

I document in https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/#what-is-asciidoctor[AsciiDoctor] since it is more feature-rich and easier to use than Markdown. Bring mathematical equations into the mix, and AsciiDoctor is in a realm its own; it can https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/stem/[directly embed LaTeX].
