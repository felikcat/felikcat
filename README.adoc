== About
A 22 year old male currently studying a 2022 CompTIA+ Networking book and using Zig.

Zig fits how I instruct a computer the most, despite knowing little, but I know a good amount of Bash. Tried high-level languages like Swift, they are uncomfortable to me with all the hand-holding and layers of abstractions, it feels like instructing an AI to do something.

I document in https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/#what-is-asciidoctor[AsciiDoctor]; more features and easier to use than Markdown. AsciiDoctor can also https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/stem/[directly embed LaTeX].
